Clinical Significance: High Cancer Risk This mutation is associated with increased cancer risk and should be regarded as clinically significant ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: NO VARIANT(S) OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE (VUS) IDENTIFIED Details About Non-Clinically significant Variants: All individuals carry DNA changes (i.e. variants) and most variants do not increase an individual's risk of cancer or other diseases. When identified variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported. Likely benign variants (Favor Polymorphisms) and benign variants (Polymorphisms) are not reported and available data indicate that these variants most likely do not cause increased cancer risk. Present evidence does not suggest that non-clinically significant variant findings be used to modify patient medical management beyond what is indicated by the personal and family history and any other clinically significant findings. Variant Classification: Myriad's myVision™ Variant Classification Program performs ongoing evaluations of variant classifications. In certain cases healthcare providers may be contacted for more clinical information or to arrange family testing to aid in variant classification. When new evidence about a variant is identified and determined to result in clinical significance and management change that information will automatically be made available to the healthcare provider through an amended report. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION GENES ANALYZED Unless otherwise noted sequencing and large rearrangement analyses were performed on the following genes: BRCA1 BRCA2 Indication for Testing: It is our understanding that this individual was identified for testing due to a personal or family history suggestive of a hereditary predisposition for cancer. Associated Cancer Risks and Clinical Management: If a clinically significant mutation is identified please see the management tool associated with this report for a summary of cancer risk and professional society medical management guidelines that may be useful in developing a plan for this patient. Testing of other family members may assist in the interpretation of this patient's test result. Analysis Description: The Technical Specifications summary (https://www.myriadpro. com/documents-and-forms/technical specifications/) describes the analysis method performance nomenclature and interpretive criteria of this test. Current testing technologies are unable to definitively determine whether a variant is germline or somatic in origin which may significantly impact risk estimates and medical management therefore these results should be correlated with this patient's personal and family history. The interpretation of this test may also be impacted if the patient has a hematologic malignancy or an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. ",BRCA2

CALR mutations are found in traditionally defined essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis. Mutations in PPMID and TET2 can be found within the MPN clone as well as in age-related clonal hematopoiesis and PPMID mutations can be associated with previous exposure to chemotherapy. Mutations in GNAS are associated with a higher risk of disease transformation. The knowledge bank prediction takes into account patient age clinical characteristics at presentation and the somatic mutations present in the sample to make predictions of future patient survival and disease transformation. In this patient this approach estimates a 53% chance of overall survival (OS) at 5 years and a 56% risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at 10 years. ",CALR

Partner is a carrier of CF. Your Result Carrier of cystic fibrosis ABOUT THE TEST This test looked at a gene called CFTR. Everyone has two copies of this gene (one from their mother and one from their father). Alterations to this gene can cause the condition cystic fibrosis (CF). If you have an alteration in both copies of your CFTR genes you will have CF. If you have an alteration in only one copy of CFTR you will not have CF but will be a 'carrier'. Carriers are healthy but may pass on their altered gene to any children WHAT THIS RESULT MEANS FOR YOU The test found that you have an alteration in one copy of your CFTR genes making you a carrier of CF. If you have children with someone who is also a carrier of CF there is a 1 in 4 (25%) chance in each pregnancy that the child will have CF If you have children with someone who has not been tested for CF there is less than 1 in 100 (less than 1%) chance that those children will have CF (some risk remains as your partner may be a carrier but not know) In the UK population around 1 in 25 (4%) people are carriers of CF. Because you are a carrier of CF your close relatives have an increased chance of also being CF carriers 50 carrier testing can now be offered to your adult relatives NEXT STEPS • You can be referred to the Clinical Genetics Service to discuss your options when planning a family. Please ask your doctor for this referral if it has not been made. Take this report with you to any appointments. • If your relatives would like to be tested they should ask their GP about CF carrier testing.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition characterized by the production of abnormally thick sticky mucus particularly in the lungs and digestive system. While it is normal to have mucus lining the organs of the respiratory digestive and reproductive systems in order to lubricate and protect them in people with CF this mucus is thick and sticky. This abnormal mucus results in the clogging and obstructing of various systems in the body. CF is a chronic condition that worsens over time. HOW COMMON IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS? According to the National Institutes of Health CF is the most common deadly inherited condition among Caucasians in the United States. Disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene are more common in some ethnic populations than others.

PROGNOSTIC ASSOCIATIONS L Describes if a therapy is approved in the patient's tumor type or if a therapy is approved for the same mutation but in a different disease state No prognostic associations at this time. INTERPRETATION SUMMARY An EGFR TKI resistance mutation was found in this patients sample EGFR T790M (p. Thr790Met). One other mutation was identified in this sample. An EGFR exon 19 deletion (p.Glu746_Ala750del) was detected. Additionally FISH for ALK and ROS1 was negative. Activating EGFR exon 19 mutations are in-frame deletions or in-frame deletion/insertions occurring in the kinase domain of EGFR that result in increased signaling by the protein. These mutations are associated with sensitivity to first and second generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS) such as afatinib erlotinib and gefitinib (NCCN Guidelines Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Version 7.2015; 25278773). However the EGFR T790M mutation impairs binding of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors to the EGFR catalytic site and affects the ability of TKls to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (15737014). This mutation is associated with primary and secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs even in the presence of activating EGFR mutations such as the EGFR exon 19 deletion detected in this sample (15737014 15728811 18437168).

P447L) Consequence : Missense Mutation details 6 Interpretation Jean Helix is heterozygous for a previously reported HNF1A missense mutation p.Pro447Leu (Hansen et al 1997 Diabetes 46: 726-730). This mutation is predicted to be pathogenic and the result confirms a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) subtype HNF1A. Mutation testing is recommended for other affected family members in order to confirm the aetiology of their diabetes. First-degree relatives who are not known to have diabetes may be tested initially by performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Referral to Clinical Genetics is recommended for family members with normal OGTT who request predictive molecular genetic testing. Each of this patient's offspring will be at 50% risk of inheriting this mutation and developing diabetes. 7 Results are dependent on samples being correctly labelled and family relationships as indicated.

Interpretation: ) This individual is heterozygous for a published missense mutation in the KCNQ1 gene consistent with a genetic form of LQTS. Expands on the genetics and the clinical significance of the identified mutation Familial Long QT syndrome is primarily an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutation(s) in cardiac ion channel genes. Mutations in these genes tend to prolong the duration of the ventricular action potential thus lengthening the QT interval seen on an ECG (Goldenberg I et al. 2008; Priori S et al. 2004). LQTS is associated with increased risk for syncope ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in young adults with normal heart structure (Vincent G 1998). Mutations in the KCNQ1 gene have been reported in approximately 39%-62% of patients with autosomal dominant long QT syndrome and are associated with increased risk of cardiac events triggered by emotion exercise and vigorous activity particularly swimming (Priori S et al. 2004; Vincent G 2009). p.Arg555Cys (R555C) CGC>TGC: c.1663 C>T in exon 13 of the KCNQ1 gene (NM_000218.2) KCNQ1 R555C The R555C mutation in KCNQ1 has been reported multiple times in association with LQTS including one study that found this mutation was associated with drug-induced symptoms and often borderline or no QT prolongation in three families with LQTS (Donger C et al. 1997; Park K et al. 2005; Kapplinger J et al. 2009). Functional studies report that R555C results in abnormal potassium channel function (Peroz D et al. 2008; Coyan F et al. 2014). This mutation was absent from >2600 published control alleles (Kapplinger J et al. 2009) and the R555C mutation was not observed in approximately 6500 samples from individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Located in the C-terminus of KCNQ1 R555C results in a nonconservative amino acid substitution which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity charge size and/or other properties (Park K et al. 2005). Other missense mutations affecting the same codon (R555H R555S) as well as mutations in nearby codons (G548D V554A K557E R562M) have also been observed in patients with LQTS further supporting the functional importance of this residue and region of the protein (Stenson et al. 2014). In summary R555C in the KCNQ1 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation. ",KCNQ1

INTERPRETATION KCNQ1 Lys 362 Arg - Possible Deleterious Mutation Found: This test result indicates the presence of the genetic mutation KCNQ1 Lys 362 Arg. This mutation is a Class II variant meaning it is a type that may have the potential to cause a familial arrhythmia-causing syndrome: Type 1 Long QT Syndrome (LQT1) (Tester et al. Heart Rhythm. 2005 May;2(5):507-17 (15840476)). However approximately 5% of reported healthy volunteers have been found to possess class Il mutations. Therefore extreme caution and comprehensive clinical evaluation are advised with respect to the incorporation of this variant information into treatment decisions. Based upon this test result all first-degree relatives of this patient (offspring siblings parents) should undergo a careful clinical evaluation that includes a screening electrocardiogram and genetic testing to determine the presence or absence of this specific mutation. Evaluation including genetic testing of extended relatives (second-degree relatives: grandparents /aunts /uncles /nieces /nephews; third-degree relatives such as cousins great aunts/uncles etc. and beyond) should be directed based upon the family history or guided by transmission pattern established following genetic test results of first-degree relatives. For example if this mutation is detected in an affected individual's mother but not in the father then all of the mother's first-degree relatives should receive thorough evaluation whereas the paternal side of the family would require no further evaluation. To order the FAMILION Family Specific Test for family members of this patient use the following Family Specific Code: GPI-This code must be included on the FAMILION Test Requisition/Payment Authorization Form (Form A) for the Family Specific Test Polymorphism(s) Found: This test result indicates identification of one or more genetic variants that have been identified previously in normal subjects and are considered polymorphisms (Class III variants). These variants are not likely arrhythmia syndrome-causing variants. Family screening for the presence of class Ill variants is not recommended. ",KCNQ1

J Indicates that a known disease-causing mutation was identifed This analysis has identified a homoplasmic G>A nucleotide substitution at position 11778 in the MT-ND4 gene of the mitochondrial genome. This variant is denoted G11778A or m.11778 G>A at the mtDNA level and p.Arg340His (R340H) at the protein level. Expands on the genetics and the clinical significance of the identified mutation This individual's haplogroup and a table of observed polymorphisms are also provided.* This individual carries mitochondrial haplogroup J a common European haplogroup. Haplogroup J has been reported to play a role in the expression of LHON by increasing the penetrance of the primary LHON mutations m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C (Torroni et al. 1997). Interpretation The entire mitochondrial genome was amplified and sequenced from the submitted specimen. A homoplasmic mutation m.11778G>A was detected in the MT-ND4 gene. This mutation is commonly associated with Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) (Wallace et al. 1988). This result confirms the clinical diagnosis of LHON in this individual. Recommendation: Mitochondrial DNA disorders are maternally inherited. Genetic counseling and testing appropriate - 7 matrilineal relatives for this mutation are recommended. Methods: The entire mitochondrial genome from the submitted sample was amplified and sequenced using a solid state sequencing by-synthesis process. DNA sequence was assembled and analyzed in comparison with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) and the reported mutations and polymorphisms listed in the MITOMAP database (http://www.mitomap.org). The presence of a disease associated sequence variant if present is confirmed by conventional dideoxy sequence analysis or other methods. A reference library of more than 6000 samples from different ethnic groups and online databases for mtDNA variations is used to evaluate variants of unknown clinical significance.

Relevant History: Result: POSITIVE Gene Ref. Seq. Result PRESENT Zygosity Heterozygous Coding DNA c.697 C>T PTEN Variant p.Arg233Ter (R233X) NM_000314.4 Interpretation: This result indicates that this individual harbors the R233X pathogenic variant previously identified in a sibling. Variants elsewhere in the evaluated gene would not be identified by this targeted analysis. The R233X variant in the PTEN gene has been reported previously in multiple unrelated individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome and has also been reported in a family segregating a phenotype of Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (Liaw et al. 1997; Marsh et al. 1998; Busch et al. 2013; Ngeow et al. 2014). This variant has also been reported to have occurred de novo in at least one individual with features suggestive of PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) (Tsujita et al. 2016). Functional studies show impaired protein phosphatase activity and enhanced proteasomal degradation in lymphoblasts isolated from individuals with PHTS who harbor this variant (He et al. 2013). The R233X iant was not ob in approximately 6500 ind duals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Based on currently available evidence we interpret R233X as pathogenic and its presence consistent with a risk to develop features of PHTS for this individual. ",PTEN

L ATM I. No additional variants of clinical or unknown significance were detected by sequencing or deletion/duplication analysis Only mutations this panel. detected appear here Lifetime cancer risks due to a single ATM mutation include: an increased risk for breast cancer in women and an increased risk for colon and pancreatic cancers in both women and men. See interpretation. ** ** Only the most commonly associated cancer risks are listed Lifetime risks appear only with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant result and provides a summary of the most commonly associated cancer risks Recommendations Genetic counseling is recommended to discuss the implications of these test results. Breast MRI screening is recommended in addition to mammographic screening for any woman with at least a 20% lifetime risk for breast cancer (Saslow 2007 NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian v.2.2015). For individuals and family members of reproductive age assessment of the reproductive risk associated with being a carrier of an ATM mutation is recommended.

Epilepsy hypopigmented macules and developmental delay. Test Indications: Result: POSITIVE Gene cDNA Variant TSC) Zygosity Heterozygous c.1997+1 G>A IVS15+1 G>A Classification Disease-causing mutation Only mutations detected appear here Interpretation: - No other reportable variants were detected by sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. The c.1997+1 G>A splice site mutation has been reported previously in an individual with a clinical diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis (Au et al. 2007). This splice mutation alters the canonical donor site in intron 15. It is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to nonsensemediated mRNA decay or to an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation. The presence of c.1997+1 G>A is consistent with the diagnosis of an tuberous sclerosis in this individual. Expands on the clinical significance of the identified mutations Recommendation: 1. Mutation-specific testing for the c.1997+1 G>A mutation in the TSC1 gene is available to the parents of - this child for an additional charge to determine if the mutation was inherited or arose de novo. If desired molecular prenatal diagnosis is available to at-risk family members to address the recurrence risk. 2. Genetic counseling is recommended to discuss the implications of this test report specifically including the risk of recurrence for this family clinical variability associated with TSC1 mutations and testing options for other at-risk family members.

MONOGENIC DISEASE RISK: 2 VARIANTS IDENTIFIED This test identified 2 genetic variant(s) that may be responsible for existing disease or the development of disease in this individual's lifetime. Disease Phenotype Gene Classification (Inheritance) Variant A1. Episodic ataxia type II CACNA1A (Autosomal Dominant) Poor coordination and balance Pathogenic p.Arg2156GlyfsX32 A2. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Progressive heart failure MYBPC3 (Autosomal Dominant) p. Thr146AsnfsX7 Pathogenic Classification Carrier Phenotype B. CARRIER RISK: 3 VARIANTS IDENTIFIED This test identified carrier status for 3 autosomal recessive disorder(s). Disease Phenotype Gene Variant Chronic lung and digestive CFTR B1.

Usher syndrome type II Hearing loss and retinitis USHPA pigmentosa p.Gly204ArgfsX12 Pathogenic Pathogenic Infertility (moderate evidence) Latent myotonia (case report only) None reported Pathogenic As a carrier for recessive genetic variants this individual is at higher risk for having a child with one or more of these highly penetrant disorders. To determine the risk for this individual's children to be affected the partner of this individual would also need to be tested for these variants. Other biologically related family members may also be carriers of these variants.'Carriers for some recessive disorders may be at risk for certain mild phenotypes. Please see variant descriptions for more information. C. PHARMACOGENOMIC ASSOCIATIONS This test identified the following variants associated with drug use and dosing. Additional pharmacogenomic results may be requested. but will require additional molecular confirmation prior to disclosure. Risk and Dosing Information Drug C1. Warfarin Decreased dose requirement. C2. Clopidogrel Typical risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events. C3. Digoxin Increased serum concentration of digoxin. C4. Metformin Typical glycemic response to metformin. C5. Simvastatin Lower risk of simvastatin-related myopathy. D. BLOOD GROUPS This test identified the ABO Rh blood type as O positive. Additional blood group information is available at the end of the report It should be noted that the disease risk section of this report is limited only to variants with evidence for causing highly penetrant disease or contributing to highly penetrant disease in a recessive manner. Not all variants identified have been analyzed and not all regions of the genome have been adequately sequenced. These results should be interpreted in the ",USH2A
