Alerted Type Message Unreviewed ! 07/13/2011 Non-incidental Level The category for the ACTC c. 301G>A (p Glu 101Lys) association to HCM 02:48 PM Change changed from Unknown Significance to Pathogenic. Mark Alerts Reviewed Current knowledge** Approved 02/09/2012 10:38 AM by Primary User Diseases/Drugs Category Variant Interpretation HCM Pathogenic The Glu 101Lys variant (ACTC) meets our criteria for pathogenicity (pcpgm.partners.org/Imm) based on segregation studies, absence in controls, and functional evidence. This variant has been reported in 8 families with HCM, apical HCM or LVNC, segregated with disease in >10 affected individuals, and was absent from 500 control chromosomes (also reported as Glu99Lys; Olson 2000, Arad 2005, Monserrat 2007, Klaassen 2008). In vitro functional analyses showed decreased force generation (Bookwalter 2006, Debold 2010) and a mouse model harboring this variant presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Song 2011). The current category field displays the variant signiicance only within the diseasestrugs that have been interpreted on each report, primarily defined by the ordered test Additional interpretations present, outside these diseases drugs are not considered * The Current knowledge only includes the following Diseases/Drugs literpreted on Report.
