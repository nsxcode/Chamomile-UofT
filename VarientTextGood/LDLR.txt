LIPIDTECH GENETIC TESTING REPORT Center details Requested by: Dr. Frank Crick* Address: 1 Double Helix Road, Arkadelphia, AR 71923 Patient details Name: Gregory Mendel* Date of birth: 29 Feb 1988 Gender: Not specified Patient ID: GATATC-12 Sample received: 20 Jan 2020 Report date: 15 Feb 2020 Result of the genetic analysis Heterozygous pathogenic variant in the LDLR gene. Result summary Gene: LDLR (RefSeq NM_000527.4) Genetic identifier: c.1646G>A (exon 11) Protein identifier: p.Gly528Asp (HGVS Nomenclature p.Gly549Asp) Mutation class: Amino acid change Interpretation This mutation is directly associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, since its pathogenicity has been validated. Validation study: Hobbs et al. (1990) Ann Rev Genet 24:133 Recommendations Referral to a genetic counsellor is recommended. Methods LipidTech's FH genetic analysis detects substitutions and indels in exons and intron-exon boundaries of the following genes: LDLR gene (familial hypercholesterolemia): 18 exons PCSK9 gene (ADH3): 12 exons LDLRAP1 gene (ARH): 9 exons APOB gene (familial defective APOB): regions of exons 26 and 29 involved in LDLR binding APOE gene: region of exon 4 The assay also detects copy number variations (CNV) in the LDLR gene associated with FH. Proprietary algorithms are used to detect genomic deletions and duplications (del-dups) in all 18 exons and the promoter region in the LDLR gene. All genes are fully analyzed by next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. 70 regions of interest are amplified from genomic DNA, isolated from whole blood or saliva, in multiplex PCR reactions that include highly purified primers for the specific amplification of regions in which mutations causing FH can be found.
