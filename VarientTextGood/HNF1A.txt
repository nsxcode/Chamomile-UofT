GENETICS LABORATORY REPORT Patient Name: Jean HELIX Date of Birth: 12/06/1997 1 Gender: Female NHS No.: 123 456 7890 Lab. No.: EX1600001 2 Sample Received: 01/01/2016 Sample Type: DNA extracted from peripheral blood Referred by: Consultant Diabetologist, City Hospital, London Date of Report: 22/01/2016 1 GENETIC TESTING FOR MATURITY ONSET DIABETES OF THE YOUNG Reason for Request 3 Jean Helix agnosed with diabetes at the age of 16 years. GAD auto-antibodies were not detected. She was initially treated with insulin and is currently treated with a sulphonylurea. There is a family history of diabetes affecting Jean's father. Mutation analysis of the HNF1A and HNF4A genes has been requested. Test methodology 1. Analysis of the promoters, coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of the HNF1A (NM_000545.6) and HNF4A (NM_175914.4) genes by Sanger sequencing. 4 5 Result: Heterozygous mutation identified Gene: HNFIA Location: Exon 7 DNA Description : c.1340C>T Protein Description : p.Pro447Leu (p. P447L) Consequence : Missense Mutation details 6 Interpretation Jean Helix is heterozygous for a previously reported HNF1A missense mutation, p.Pro447Leu (Hansen et al 1997 Diabetes 46: 726-730). This mutation is predicted to be pathogenic and the result confirms a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), subtype HNF1A. Mutation testing is recommended for other affected family members in order to confirm the aetiology of their diabetes. First-degree relatives who are not known to have diabetes may be tested initially by performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Referral to Clinical Genetics is recommended for family members with normal OGTT who request predictive molecular genetic testing. Each of this patient's offspring will be at 50% risk of inheriting this mutation and developing diabetes. 7 Results are dependent on samples being correctly labelled and family relationships as indicated. Please note that any remaining DNA will be stored in the laboratory. Signed: Signed: Clinical Scientist Consultant Clinical Scientist
