Gene & Transcript Variant Nomenclature Zygosity Classification Disease Inheritance ATM NM_0000513 c.217 218deLGA p.E73MFsX26 Heterozygous (one copy) Pathogenic Susceptibility to Breast Cancer (ATM-related) / Ataxia-Telangiectasia Autosomal Dominant/ Autosomal Recessive Cancer Risks and Recommendations Cancer Risks • Female breast cancer: Approximately 2-4 times higher than the general population lifetime risk - Other cancers (such as ovarian, pancreatic and prostate): Potentially increased compared to the general population risk *There are some rare missense alterations that are associated with higher breast cancer risk Management Options . There are medical management recommendations for certain cancer risks published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) • A personalized medical management plan should be discussed with a qualified clinician • Genetic counseling is recommended Familial Implications • Family members may be at risk of carrying the same genetic variant • Genetic testing may be indicated .
