These data were analyzed to identify previously reported variants of potential clinical relevance as well as novel variants that could reasonably be assumed to cause disease (see methodology below). All results are summarized on page 1 with further details on subsequent pages 1. RESULTS RELEVANT TO INDICATION FOR TESTING For this patient with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, we reviewed all variants found in 62 genes with known association with hereditary cardiovascular disease and identified the pathogenic variant below. This result is consistent with this individual's clinical diagnosis Disease, Phenotype Gene zygosity Classification Inheritance Transcript Variant Hypertrophic Left ventricular MYBPC3 Heterozygous Pathogenic cardiomyopathy hypertrophy NM_000256.30.2827C>T Autosomal dominant p. Arg943X II. OTHER VARIANTS OF MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE (INCIDENTAL FINDINGS) A. MONOGENIC DISEASE RISK: O VARIANTS IDENTIFIED This test did not identify any genetic variants that may be responsible for existing disease or the development of disease in this individual's lifetime B. CARRIER RISK: 2 VARIANTS IDENTIFIED This test identified carrier status for 2 autosomal recessive disorders Disease, Phenotype Gene Zygosity Classification Phenotype in Inheritance Transcript Variant carriers Cystic fibrosis Chronic lung and CFTR Heterozygous Pathogenic None Autosomal recessive digestive disease NM 000492.3 0.3846G>A reported p. Trp1282X Glycogen storage disease 7. Severe exercise PFKM Heterozygous Pathogenic None Autosomal recessive intolerance NM_000295.50.237+1G>A reported As a carrier for recessive genetic variants, this individual is at higher risk for having a child with one or more of these highly penetrant disorders. To determine the risk for this individual's future children to be affected the partner of this individual would also need to be tested for variants in these genes Other biologically related family members may also be carriers of these variants. Carriers for some recessive disorders may be at risk for certain phenotypes. Please see variant descriptions for more information C. PHARMACOGENOMIC ASSOCIATIONS This test identified the following pharmacogenomic associations Additional pharmacogenomic results may be requested, but will require additional molecular confirmation prior to disclosure Drug Risk and Dosing Information Warfarin Standard dose requirement Clopidogrel Typical response to clopidogrel Digoxin Intermediate metabolism and serum concentration of digoxin Metformin Typical glycemic response to metformin Simvastatin Typical risk of simvastatin-related myopathy D. RED BLOOD CELL AND PLATELET ANTIGENS This test identified the ABO Rh blood type as A Negative. This person showed a rare absence of the HPA-1a antigen indicating they are at risk of transfusion-related alloantibody formation and a very desirable platelet donor. Additional blood group information is available at the end of the report
