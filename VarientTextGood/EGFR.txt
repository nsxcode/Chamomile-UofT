INTERPRETATION SUMMARY An EGFR TKI resistance mutation was found in this patients sample, EGFR T790M (p. Thr790Met). One other mutation was identified in this sample. An EGFR exon 19 deletion (p.Glu746_Ala750del) was detected. Additionally, FISH for ALK and ROS1 was negative. Activating EGFR exon 19 mutations are in-frame deletions or in-frame deletion/insertions occurring in the kinase domain of EGFR that result in increased signaling by the protein. These mutations are associated with sensitivity to first and second generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS) such as afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib (NCCN Guidelines, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Version 7.2015; 25278773). However, the EGFR T790M mutation impairs binding of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors to the EGFR catalytic site and affects the ability of TKls to inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (15737014). This mutation is associated with primary and secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs, even in the presence of activating EGFR mutations, such as the EGFR exon 19 deletion detected in this sample (15737014, 15728811, 18437168).
