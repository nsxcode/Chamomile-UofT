Result: Heterozygous mutation c.8297delC, p.T2766NfsX11 was confirmed. Interpretation: The mutation predicts a frame shift in BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 2). Heterozygous alterations in the BRCA2 gene cause Hereditory Breat/Ovarian Cancer. Individuals with mutations in BRCA2 have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancers. These results should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history Method: Analysis was performed on genomic DNA isolated at the National Institutes of Health from a submitted blood sample. Exon 17 of the BRCA2 gene was PCR amplified, followed by direct DNA sequencing with the same forward and reverse primers. cDNA position numbers are based on reference sequence NM_000059.3 using nucleotide 228 as position 1 of the ATG. Bi-directional sequence was obtained and analyzed. Jennifer J. Johnston, PhD CLIA Laboratory Director Leslie G. Biesecker, MD, FACMG Clinical Consultant This test was developed and its performance determined at the NIH. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88 this laboratory has established and verified the test's accuracy and precision. CLIA ID#: 21D1062422 Page 1 of 2
