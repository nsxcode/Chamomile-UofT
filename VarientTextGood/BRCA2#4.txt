CLINICAL HISTORY ANALYSIS: BEYOND THE GENETIC RESULT, NO MODIFIED MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES IDENTIFIED BASED ON THE CLINICAL HISTORY PROVIDED Other clinical factors may influence individualized management. This analysis may be incomplete if details about cancer diagnoses, ages, family relationships or other factors were omitted or ambiguous. GENE MUTATION BRCA2 C.XXXXX (p.xxxxx) Heterozygous INTERPRETATION High Cancer Risk This patient has Hereditary Breast (HBOC). Ovarian Cancer syndrome DETAILS ABOUT: BRCA2 C.XXXXX (p.xxxxx): NM_000059.3 Functional Significance: Deleterious - Abnormal Protein Production and/or Function The heterozygous germline BRCA2 mutation c.xoxoxox is predicted to result in the premature truncation of the BRCA2 protein at amino acid position xxx (p.xxxxx). Clinical Significance: High Cancer Risk This mutation is associated with increased cancer risk and should be regarded as clinically significant. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: NO VARIANT(S) OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE (VUS) IDENTIFIED Details About Non-Clinically significant Variants: All individuals carry DNA changes (i.e., variants), and most variants do not increase an individual's risk of cancer or other diseases. When identified, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are reported. Likely benign variants (Favor Polymorphisms) and benign variants (Polymorphisms) are not reported and available data indicate that these variants most likely do not cause increased cancer risk. Present evidence does not suggest that non-clinically significant variant findings be used to modify patient medical management beyond what is indicated by the personal and family history and any other clinically significant findings. Variant Classification: Myriad's myVisionVariant Classification Program performs ongoing evaluations of variant classifications. In certain cases, healthcare providers may be contacted for more clinical information or to arrange family testing to aid in variant classification. When new evidence about a variant is identified and determined to result clinical significance and management change, that information will automatically be made available to the healthcare provider through an amended report. myriad 2019 Myriad Genetics, Inc. 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108 PH: 1-800-469-7423 FX: 801-584-3615 The format and contents of this report are proprietary and may not be copied or used without permission, except for purposes of and treating the patient identified in the report and members of his or her family.
