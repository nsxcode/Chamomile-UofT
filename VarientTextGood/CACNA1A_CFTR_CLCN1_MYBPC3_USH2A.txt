MONOGENIC DISEASE RISK: 2 VARIANTS IDENTIFIED This test identified 2 genetic variant(s) that may be responsible for existing disease or the development of disease in this individual's lifetime. Disease Phenotype Gene Classification (Inheritance) Variant A1. Episodic ataxia type II CACNA1A (Autosomal Dominant) Poor coordination and balance Pathogenic p.Arg2156GlyfsX32 A2. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Progressive heart failure MYBPC3 (Autosomal Dominant) p. Thr146AsnfsX7 Pathogenic Classification Carrier Phenotype B. CARRIER RISK: 3 VARIANTS IDENTIFIED This test identified carrier status for 3 autosomal recessive disorder(s). Disease Phenotype Gene Variant Chronic lung and digestive CFTR B1. Cystic fibrosis disease c. 1585-1G>A B2. Myotonia congenita Muscle disease CLCN1 P.Arg894x B3. Usher syndrome type II Hearing loss and retinitis USHPA pigmentosa p.Gly204ArgfsX12 Pathogenic Pathogenic Infertility (moderate evidence) Latent myotonia (case report only) None reported Pathogenic As a carrier for recessive genetic variants, this individual is at higher risk for having a child with one or more of these highly penetrant disorders. To determine the risk for this individual's children to be affected, the partner of this individual would also need to be tested for these variants. Other biologically related family members may also be carriers of these variants.'Carriers for some recessive disorders may be at risk for certain mild phenotypes. Please see variant descriptions for more information. C. PHARMACOGENOMIC ASSOCIATIONS This test identified the following variants associated with drug use and dosing. Additional pharmacogenomic results may be requested. but will require additional molecular confirmation prior to disclosure. Risk and Dosing Information Drug C1. Warfarin Decreased dose requirement. C2. Clopidogrel Typical risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events. C3. Digoxin Increased serum concentration of digoxin. C4. Metformin Typical glycemic response to metformin. C5. Simvastatin Lower risk of simvastatin-related myopathy. D. BLOOD GROUPS This test identified the ABO Rh blood type as O positive. Additional blood group information is available at the end of the report It should be noted that the disease risk section of this report is limited only to variants with evidence for causing highly penetrant disease, or contributing to highly penetrant disease in a recessive manner. Not all variants identified have been analyzed, and not all regions of the genome have been adequately sequenced. These results should be interpreted in the
