Hisama, MD Report date: Whole Exome Sequencing - Colon Cancer Report This individual has enrolled in a research study aimed at understanding the application of whole exome sequencing to clinical care, in the care of individuals with a personal and/or family history of colon cancer and/or polyps. A subset of pharmacogenetic variants, and sequence variants in a subset of non-colon cancer and/or polyp related genes, were also identified by this assay as incidental findings and are reported separately. Sequencing technology is continually evolving, and the interpretation of genetic findings may change over time. If you believe your patient has a genetic condition, evaluation by a genetic specialist to determine the need for additional genetic testing may be warranted. Indication: Molecular Test Results: Gene Variant Clinical Significance Recommendation SMAD4 c. 1573A>G Variant of Uncertain Significance for a gene heterozygote associated with Juvenile Polyposis syndrome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1469/) Refer to Medical Genetics for Genetic Counseling. No mutations were identified in APC, BMPR1A, CDH1, EPCAM, FLCN, GREM1, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, PMS1, PMS2, POLD1, POLE, PTCH1, PTEN, RET, SCG5, STK11, TGFBR2 and TP53.
