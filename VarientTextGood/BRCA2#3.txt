I Invitae Multi-Cancer Panel + RESULT: POSITIVE One Pathogenic variant identified in BRCA2. BRCA2 is associated with autosomal dominant hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia. Additional Variant(s) of Uncertain Significance identified. GENE VARIANT ZYGOSITY VARIANT CLASSIFICATION BRCA2 C.4638del (p.Phe1546Leufs*22) heterozygous PATHOGENIC PALB2 c.2482T>C (p.Cys828Arg) heterozygous Uncertain Significance About this test This diagnostic test evaluates 83 gene(s) for variants (genetic changes) that are associated with genetic disorders. Diagnostic genetic testing, when combined with family history and other medical results, may provide information to clarify individual risk, support a clinical diagnosis, and assist with the development of a personalized treatment and management strategy.
