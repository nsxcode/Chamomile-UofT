F VAN # # Family: NA Indication: Diagnostic/Family History Ethnicity: Caucasian Collected: 06/11/2016 Received: 06/12/2016 Authorized: 06/12/2016 BRCA1/2 Analyses with BreastNext RESULTS BRCA2 Pathogenic Mutation: 5'UTR_EX10del SUMMARY POSITIVE: Pathogenic Mutation Detected INTERPRETATION This individual is heterozygous for the 5'UTR_EX10del pathogenic mutation in the BRCA2 gene. . This result is consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome Risk estimate: 45-84% lifetime risk of breast cancer and 11-18% letime risk of ovarian cancer (females only), at least a 6% ifetime risk of male breast cancer and 15% risk of prostate cancer by age 65 (males only), and increased fetime pancreatic cancer risk. . The expression and severity of disease for this individual cannot be predicted. â€¢ Genetic testing for pathogenic mutations in family members can be helpful in identifying at-risk individuals. Genetic counseling is a recommended option for all individuals undergoing genetic testing. No additional pathogenic mutations, variants of unknown significance, or gross deletions or duplications were detected. Genes Analyzed: ATM, BARD 1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MRE11A, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RADSO, RADS1C, RADS1D and TP53 (sequencing and deletion/duplication). BRCA2 Additional Information The S'UTR_EX10del gross deletion spans the Suntranslated region (5'UTR) through coding exon 10 in the BRCA2 gene; however, the exact breakpoints of the deletion were not determined. This alteration is expected to result in loss of function due to an abnormal transcript, a translational frameshift leading to premature truncation, or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. As such, this alteration is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation The BRCA2 (OMIM 600185) tumor suppressor gene is located at 13q13.1 and encodes the 3418 amino acid BRCA2 protein, BRCA2 is involved in the DNA repair process via homologous recombination and double-strand break repair. Pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene are associated with significantly increased lifetime risks for breast and ovarian cancers in women. Early studies estimated a female breast cancer Close
