Relevant History: Result: POSITIVE Gene Ref. Seq. Result PRESENT Zygosity Heterozygous Coding DNA c.697 C>T PTEN Variant p.Arg233Ter (R233X) NM_000314.4 Interpretation: This result indicates that this individual harbors the R233X pathogenic variant previously identified in a sibling. Variants elsewhere in the evaluated gene would not be identified by this targeted analysis. The R233X variant in the PTEN gene has been reported previously in multiple unrelated individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome and has also been reported in a family segregating a phenotype of Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (Liaw et al., 1997; Marsh et al., 1998; Busch et al., 2013; Ngeow et al., 2014). This variant has also been reported to have occurred de novo in at least one individual with features suggestive of PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) (Tsujita et al., 2016). Functional studies show impaired protein phosphatase activity and enhanced proteasomal degradation in lymphoblasts isolated from individuals with PHTS who harbor this variant (He et al., 2013). The R233X iant was not ob in approximately 6,500 ind duals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Based on currently available evidence, we interpret R233X as pathogenic, and its presence consistent with a risk to develop features of PHTS for this individual.
