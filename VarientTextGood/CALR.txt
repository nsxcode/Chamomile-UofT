CALR mutations are found in traditionally defined essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis. Mutations in PPMID and TET2 can be found within the MPN clone as well as in age-related clonal hematopoiesis, and PPMID mutations can be associated with previous exposure to chemotherapy. Mutations in GNAS are associated with a higher risk of disease transformation. The knowledge bank prediction takes into account patient age, clinical characteristics at presentation, and the somatic mutations present in the sample to make predictions of future patient survival and disease transformation. In this patient, this approach estimates a 53% chance of overall survival (OS) at 5 years and a 56% risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at 10 years.
