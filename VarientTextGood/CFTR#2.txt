Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition characterized by the production of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, particularly in the lungs and digestive system. While it is normal to have mucus lining the organs of the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems in order to lubricate and protect them, in people with CF this mucus is thick and sticky. This abnormal mucus results in the clogging and obstructing of various systems in the body. CF is a chronic condition that worsens over time. HOW COMMON IS CYSTIC FIBROSIS? According to the National Institutes of Health, CF is the most common deadly inherited condition among Caucasians in the United States. Disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene are more common in some ethnic populations than others.
