All genes relevant to the indication had adequate coverage (>95% at 20X). Please note that the presence of pathogenic variants in genes not analyzed or with incomplete coverage cannot be fully excluded. VARIANTS RELEVANT TO INDICATION FOR TESTING One pathogenic variant in LMNA was identified in this individual. The LMNA gene is strongly associated with DCM, which is consistent with the reported clinical diagnosis. No other variants of relevance to the indication were identified.

Exon 1 Dilated Cardiomyopathy Autosomal dominant Pathogenic OTHER VARIANTS OF MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE (INCIDENTAL FINDINGS) Incidental findings are variants of medical significance that are not associated with the individual's reported indication. Please note that the presence of pathogenic variants in genes with incomplete coverage or in genes not examined cannot be fully excluded. Please contact the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine for coverage information on genes analyzed for incidental findings. Monogenic Disease Risk This test did NOT identify genetic variants that may be responsible for other diseases unrelated to this individual's clinical presentation. Please see limitations for more detail. a Carrier Status This individual is a carrier of 1 heterozygous pathogenic variant in a gene associated with a recessive disorder that is unrelated to this individual's reported phenotype. In the heterozygous state, this variant is not known to play a role in disease. Please see below for more detailed variant information.
