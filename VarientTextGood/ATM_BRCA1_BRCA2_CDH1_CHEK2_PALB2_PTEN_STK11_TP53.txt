Family history of breast and other cancer. No reported history of genetic testing. Provides the overall classification of the result, Results Summary: POSITIVE with abnormal diagnosis highlighted in red Gene Results Classification Zygosity c.7327C>T (p.Arg2443Ter) PATHOGENIC HETEROZYGOUS This individual is heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in ATM, consistent with an increased risk for cancer. L ATM I. No additional variants of clinical or unknown significance were detected by sequencing or deletion/duplication analysis Only mutations this panel. detected appear here Lifetime cancer risks due to a single ATM mutation include: an increased risk for breast cancer in women and an increased risk for colon and pancreatic cancers in both women and men. See interpretation. ** ** Only the most commonly associated cancer risks are listed Lifetime risks appear only with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant result, and provides a summary of the most commonly associated cancer risks Recommendations Genetic counseling is recommended to discuss the implications of these test results. Breast MRI screening is recommended in addition to mammographic screening for any woman with at least a 20% lifetime risk for breast cancer (Saslow 2007, NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian v.2.2015).
